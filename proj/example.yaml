instructions: |
    For the following instructions, you should use your own words.
    The section 'Introduction', you should focus on:
    In the first paragraph, describe the problem of finding hypotenus in a triangle.
    In the section 'Related work', you should show the picture
    '/file=images/multi-agent.jpeg' to discuss we write a paper by defining a
    title and hypothesis, writing topic sentences, expanding topic sentences into
    paragraphs, writing the paragraphs, and finally reviewing what you have written.
results: >
    In this section provide a quick derivation of pythagorean theorem then, as in an example on how you can put a results table. In the table you can put katets and hypotenus lengths
    <table>
    <tr>
        <td></td>
        <td></td>

    </tr>
