    Introduction: |
        For the following instructions, you should use your own words.
        The section 'Introduction', you should focus on:
        In the first paragraph, describe the problem of finding hypotenus in a triangle.
        Write the main formula of pythagorean triangle. Insert the picture `multi-agent.jpeg`.
    Derivation: |
        Using the derivation described in relevant documents, structure it in a logical manner and write it in paper.
