# Pythagorean Theorem Proof

Planning

1. The introduction outlines the problem of determining the hypotenuse of a right triangle and presents the Pythagorean theorem as the central relation to be proved.

## Introduction

Determining the length of the hypotenuse in a right triangle is a classical problem in geometry: given the lengths of the two legs, one seeks a relation that yields the longest side. The main formula of the Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle with legs a and b and hypotenuse c, a^2 + b^2 = c^2. This work aims to provide a proof of this relation using squares and triangles. ![multi-agent.jpeg](multi-agent.jpeg)
