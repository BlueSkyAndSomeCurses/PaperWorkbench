Agentic LLMs lower the technical barriers to entry for novice researchers and allow experts to focus on high-value creative tasks rather than low-level implementation. By automating tedious aspects of the process, such as data preparation, debugging complex code, and formatting citations, these tools free researchers to concentrate on conceptual design and critical thinking. For example, PlotGen assists users who may lack expertise with sophisticated visualization toolkits by automatically translating natural language requests into precise scientific plots, thereby enhancing accessibility. Furthermore, operating these agents in a "co-pilot" mode—where humans provide high-level guidance and feedback—has been shown to significantly improve the utility and quality of the final paper compared to fully autonomous modes. This collaborative approach not only increases productivity by reducing debugging time but also ensures the final output remains aligned with the researcher's specific intent and scientific standards.
