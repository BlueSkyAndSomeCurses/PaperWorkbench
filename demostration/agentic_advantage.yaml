  Introduction: |
    For the following instructions, you should use your own words based on the provided text block 'Accelerating Scientific Discovery and Reducing Costs'.
    The section 'Introduction' should focus on:
    1. The current bottlenecks in scientific discovery, specifically the lengthy and costly nature of manual research processes.
    2. Introduce the concept of Agentic LLMs as a solution to automate the entire lifecycle from literature review to reporting.
    3. [cite_start]Highlight key statistics, such as the potential for an 84% reduction in research expenses and low operational costs (e.g., $2.33 per paper)[cite: 13, 69].
    4. Conclude with the thesis that these systems allow for simultaneous exploration of multiple ideas.
  Related Work: |
    Using the files `2501.04227v2.pdf` (Source 1) and `2502.00988v1.pdf` (Source 2), summarize existing approaches to automated research.
    1. [cite_start]Discuss 'The AI Scientist' and its limitations regarding human interaction[cite: 49].
    2. [cite_start]Mention 'ChemCrow' and 'Coscientist' for domain-specific automation[cite: 98].
    3. [cite_start]Contrast these with the proposed approach, referencing the 'Agent Laboratory' framework which acts as a co-pilot rather than a fully autonomous replacement[cite: 54].
  System Methodology: |
    Using the file `2501.04227v2.pdf`, describe the architecture of the proposed system.
    1. [cite_start]Detail the three primary phases: Literature Review, Experimentation, and Report Writing[cite: 151].
    2. [cite_start]Describe the specialized agents involved, such as the 'PhD Student' for review and 'MLE-Solver' for coding[cite: 156, 174].
    3. Insert the diagram  to illustrate the pipeline.
  Agent Roles and Feedback Mechanisms: |
    Using the provided text block 'Enhancing Output Quality via Specialized Roles and Iterative Feedback' and `2502.00988v1.pdf`, explain the multi-agent collaboration.
    1. [cite_start]Describe the role decomposition (e.g., Query Planning, Code Generation)[cite: 2526].
    2. [cite_start]Focus on the 'Multimodal Feedback' mechanism where agents provide visual, lexical, and numerical critiques to refine outputs[cite: 2528].
    3. [cite_start]Explain how this iterative self-reflection leads to higher accuracy on benchmarks like MatPlotBench[cite: 2529].
  Experimental Results: |
    Using the text block 'Accelerating Scientific Discovery and Reducing Costs' and the file `llm_researcher_metrics.csv`.
    1. [cite_start]Discuss the quantitative benefits, specifically the speed and cost-efficiency of using different backends like gpt-4o[cite: 723].
    2. Generate a line plot from `llm_researcher_metrics.csv` comparing 'Inference Cost' vs. 'Paper Quality Score' for different models.
    3. [cite_start]Analyze the trade-offs between cost (e.g., $2.33 for gpt-4o) and performance[cite: 727].
  Broader Impact and Democratization: |
    Using the provided text block 'Democratizing Research and Focusing Human Effort on Ideation'.
    1. [cite_start]Discuss how this tool lowers technical barriers for novice researchers[cite: 2550].
    2. [cite_start]Explain the shift in human role from low-level implementation to high-level creative ideation and critical thinking[cite: 14].
    3. [cite_start]Mention the 'co-pilot' mode benefits in enhancing utility and user trust[cite: 63].
