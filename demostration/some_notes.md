Agentic LLMs can significantly expedite the scientific discovery process by automating the entire research lifecycle, from the initial literature review to the final report generation. Frameworks like "Agent Laboratory" demonstrate that autonomous agents can effectively handle time-consuming tasks such as planning experiments, writing code, and interpreting results, which historically required substantial human time and resources. By streamlining these workflows, agentic systems can drastically lower the financial barrier to research; for example, Agent Laboratory achieved an 84% reduction in research expenses compared to previous autonomous methods. Furthermore, specific agent configurations, such as those using the gpt-4o backend, allow for rapid execution of complex research workflows at a very low cost, averaging just $2.33 per paper. This efficiency enables researchers to explore multiple ideas simultaneously rather than being constrained by limited resources, thereby increasing the overall likelihood of making significant discoveries.
