The use of multi-agent frameworks improves the accuracy and quality of research outputs by employing specialized agents that mimic a human research team's structure. In systems like PlotGen, distinct agents are assigned specific roles—such as a "Query Planning Agent" for breaking down tasks and a "Code Generation Agent" for execution—which allows for a more organized and error-free workflow. Crucially, these systems leverage iterative feedback loops to refine their work; PlotGen, for instance, uses multimodal feedback agents (visual, lexical, and numerical) to critique and debug visualizations, ensuring data accuracy and aesthetic alignment. Similarly, Agent Laboratory includes a "paper-solver" module that iteratively refines manuscripts based on simulated peer reviews, checking for clarity, soundness, and contribution. This structured self-reflection allows agentic systems to outperform standard baselines, achieving higher scores on benchmarks like MatPlotBench and producing code that rivals state-of-the-art methods.
